# Apple Siri Remote Search Button Cover

Got fed up with picking up my Siri Remote and accidentally activating the search by pressing the button on the side.

Very simple design with 2 versions:

## Short Version
This is a 6mm wide cover which exposes either side of the button so that it can still be pressed.

## Long Version
This completely covers the button and has an access hole through which you can still press the button.
